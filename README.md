# Built With
NodeJS
    
# Soon to be built with
Selenium - Used for the web crawler, necessary to render JS 

[Tinygrad](http://github.com/geohot/tinygrad) with YOLOv2 - Used to determine if there is a cat within the scraped images

# Road Map

- [ ] Create multi-threaded selenium bot that scrapes images then visits all links on webpage which stores visited websites in a database
- [ ] Store md5 hashes of images in database to ensure no duplicate images are downloaded, even if they are deleted
- [ ] Create bot that removes images that do not contain pictures of cats
- [ ] Obtain additional storage and hosting to hold the future terabytes of cat images
- [ ] Create a better front-end webpage for https://crime.cx/
